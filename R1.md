## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode (2020)

### Day 1: April 10. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning about React framework and working through the tutorial. 

Languages/Tools worked with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/ReactJS

**Link to work:** [React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial App](https://github.com/jore1229/react-ttt-tutorial/commit/8b0d00243ee52a92e2265b43b6f7df42cb1644f8)

**Thoughts:** Taking another stab at this challenge during the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown.

### Day 2: April 11. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tic-tac-toe tutorial in React. Learned about state management between parents and children components, mutability and immutability, the setState() command, functional components, and event handlers. Once the application was finished, I set up a simple node.js server to serve the app, and then performed a production build. The app is available on Heroku in the link below. 

Languages/Tools worked with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/ReactJS
- Heroku

**Thoughts:** React is very different from Angular! State management is something I need to keep working on. In addition, from having worked with both typescript and javascript, typescript seems far easier to work with. For my next step, I am going to attempt to re-write the tic-tac-toe application using typescript instead.
