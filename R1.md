## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode (2020)

### Day 1: April 10. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning about React framework and working through the tutorial. 

Languages/Tools worked with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/ReactJS

**Link to work:** [React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial App](https://github.com/jore1229/react-ttt-tutorial/commit/8b0d00243ee52a92e2265b43b6f7df42cb1644f8)

**Thoughts:** Taking another stab at this challenge during the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown.


### Day 2: April 11. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tic-tac-toe tutorial in React. Learned about state management between parents and children components, mutability and immutability, the setState() command, functional components, and event handlers. Once the application was finished, I set up a simple node.js server to serve the app, and then performed a production build. The app is available on Heroku in the link below. 

Languages/Tools worked with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/ReactJS
- Heroku

**Thoughts:** React is very different from Angular! State management is something I need to keep working on. In addition, from having worked with both typescript and javascript, typescript seems far easier to work with. For my next step, I am going to attempt to re-write the tic-tac-toe application using typescript instead.


### Day 3: April 12. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new project using Angular/Typescript to recreate the Tic-Tac-Toe app in React (no hand-holding this time). Had to re-learn the general project structure for Angular and working with Typescript. Tried to emulate React's state/prop handling between components and realized it was quickly becoming a mess. Setup a service instead to function between all components (parents and children) to successfully pass data back and forth. Also added a means to query all children components on a parent component to inspect their innerHTML. The project is almost complete, and just needs to add the user functionality.

**Thoughts:** Initially I tried to get React working with Typescript - there are many tutorials on how to do this, but my experience with it (especially coming from Angular) was very painful. I also had a very hard time setting up webpack and trying to get styling/css files to work properly. Eventually I abandoned it and moved back to Angular to use the Typescript instead. Comparing Angular and React, it is easy to see that the React code is far more compact. For example, React has native prop/state built in for sharing data between components, whereas with Angular to do so you either need to (1) set up events and listeners between components, or (2) set up a service. However, coming from a C# background, nearly everything is event-driven, so employing (2) seemed very natural to me. With React I had the impression of a lot of hand-waving; the code is very compact and I would have to keep looking through it repeatedly to understand what was happening. The Angular code is far more verbose, but I can follow along with exactly what is happening. I also willfully admit my bias in this regard too.


### Day 4/5: April 13/14. Monday/Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the creation of the typescript-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. I learned how to implement both parent-child data exchanges via the Angular ng tools, and also use services to interact between multiple components. I ran into some issues with state-change errors (value from parent to child getting changed before one or the other finished rendering), and I need to learn more about state management. The application now functions identically to the React version.

**Thoughts:** The Angular project is definitely larger and more verbose than React. However, I personally prefer separating all of the individual code responsibility (logic, template, styling, etc.), and I found the React code sort of "hand-wavy"; with Angular, I can step through each and every process to understand how data is transferred. With React, there is so much syntactic-sugar that I found it difficult to follow. On the other hand, what I could do in one line in React might take me 5 or 10 in Angular, not to mention needing to understand the Angular template ecosystem. There are definitely pros and cons to both, but I am planning to stick with Angular moving forward.
